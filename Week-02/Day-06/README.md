# Day 6: Header Linked Lists and Problem-Solving

## Theory

### Concept and Use-Cases of Header Linked Lists

A header linked list is a type of linked list that includes a special node at the beginning called the header node. This header node does not hold any data pertinent to the application but is used to simplify list manipulations by providing a node to point to the start of the list.

## Benefits:

Simplified List Operations: Operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal become more straightforward as they can be uniformly applied even if the list is initially empty.
Ease of Maintenance: Header nodes can make the code for list operations cleaner and easier to maintain.

### Operations Specific to Header Linked Lists:

Insertion: Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or a specific position.
Deletion: Removing a node from the beginning, end, or a specific position.
Traversal: Accessing each node in the list starting from the header node.
