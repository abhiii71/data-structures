# Day 4: Circular Linked Lists

## Theory

Concept and Use-Cases of Circular Linked Lists

A circular linked list is a type of linked list in which the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle. This structure can be either singly or doubly linked.

### Benefits:

Circular Traversal: You can traverse the entire list starting from any node.
Useful in Certain Applications: Circular linked lists are particularly useful in scenarios where the list needs to be cyclic, such as:

Round-robin scheduling

Circular buffers

Certain game implementations

### Operations Specific to Circular Linked Lists:

Insertion: Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or a specific position.
Deletion: Removing a node from the beginning, end, or a specific position.
Traversal: Accessing each node in the list starting from any node.
