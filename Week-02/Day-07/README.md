# WEEK 2 CONCLUSION:  

## Day 1: Introduction to Singly Linked Lists

### Theory

#### Basic Concept of Singly Linked Lists:

Definition: A singly linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains a data part and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.
Node Structure: Each node has two components:
data: Stores the actual data.
next: A pointer/reference to the next node in the list.
Head Pointer: A special pointer that points to the first node in the linked list. If the list is empty, the head pointer is null.
Basic Operations:

##### Insertion:

At the Beginning: To insert a new node at the start, the new node’s next pointer is set to the current head, and then the head pointer is updated to this new node.
At the End: To insert at the end, traverse the list until you reach the last node (whose next pointer is null), then set the last node’s next pointer to the new node.
At the Middle: To insert at a specific position, traverse to the node just before the desired position and adjust pointers accordingly.

##### Deletion:
From the Beginning: Update the head pointer to point to the second node.
From the End: Traverse to the second-last node and set its next pointer to null.
From the Middle: Traverse to the node just before the one to be deleted, adjust its next pointer to skip the deleted node.

##### Traversal:

Start from the head and follow each node’s next pointer until you reach the end (null). Print or process each node’s data.

# Day 2: Advanced Singly Linked List Operations

## Theory

### Reversing a Linked List:

Objective: Reverse the direction of the list so that the head becomes the tail and vice versa.

#### Algorithm:

Initialize three pointers: prev as null, current as head, and next as null.
Iterate through the list. For each node, store its next node, update its next pointer to point to the previous node, move the prev and current pointers one step forward.
Finally, update the head pointer to prev.
Detecting Loops:

#####  Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm:
Concept: Use two pointers (slow and fast). Move the slow pointer one step and the fast pointer two steps at a time. If there is a loop, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer.

###### Steps:

Initialize two pointers, slow and fast, at the head.
Move slow one step and fast two steps in each iteration.
If slow equals fast, there is a loop. If fast reaches the end (null), there is no loop.
Finding the Middle Element:

##### Two-pointer Technique:

Concept: Use two pointers, one (slow) moving one step at a time and the other (fast) moving two steps. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle.

###### Steps:
Initialize slow and fast pointers at the head.
Move slow one step and fast two steps in each iteration.
When fast reaches the end, slow will be at the middle.

# Day 3: Introduction to Doubly Linked Lists

## Theory

### Structure and Benefits:

Node Structure: Each node has three components:
data: Stores the actual data.
next: A pointer to the next node.
prev: A pointer to the previous node.

#### Benefits:

Allows traversal in both forward and backward directions.
Easier to delete a given node since you have a pointer to the previous node.

#### Operations:

##### Insertion:

At the Beginning: Update the new node’s next to point to the current head and the current head’s prev to point to the new node. Then update the head to the new node.
At the End: Traverse to the last node and update its next to the new node. Set the new node’s prev to the last node.
At the Middle: Similar to singly linked lists but also update the prev pointers.

##### Deletion:

From the Beginning: Update the head to the next node and set the new head’s prev to null.
From the End: Update the second-last node’s next to null.
From the Middle: Adjust the next and prev pointers of the surrounding nodes to bypass the node to be deleted.

##### Traversal:

Forward Traversal: Start from the head and follow the next pointers.
Backward Traversal: Start from the tail and follow the prev pointers.

# Day 4: Circular Linked Lists

## Theory

### Concept and Use-Cases:

Concept: In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle. There is no null at the end.
Use-Cases: Useful in applications where the data needs to be cyclically repeated, such as round-robin scheduling.

#### Operations:

##### Insertion:

At the Beginning: Insert a new node such that its next pointer points to the current head and the last node points to this new node. Update the head pointer.
At the End: Traverse to the last node and set its next to the new node. Set the new node’s next to the head.
At the Middle: Traverse to the node just before the desired position, adjust the next pointers.

###### Deletion:

From the Beginning: Update the head to the next node and set the last node’s next to the new head.
From the End: Traverse to the second-last node and set its next to the head.
From the Middle: Traverse to the node just before the one to be deleted, adjust its next pointer to bypass the node to be deleted.

###### Traversal:

Start from the head and follow the next pointers until you reach the head again.

# Day 5: Circular Doubly Linked Lists

## Theory

### Concept and Use-Cases:

Concept: Similar to a doubly linked list but the last node’s next pointer points to the head, and the head’s prev pointer points to the last node, forming a circular structure.
Use-Cases: Useful when you need to traverse in both directions in a cyclic manner.

#### Operations:

##### Insertion:

At the Beginning: Insert a new node such that its next points to the current head, its prev points to the tail, and update the head and tail’s pointers accordingly.
At the End: Set the new node’s next to the head and its prev to the current tail. Update the tail and head’s pointers.
At the Middle: Traverse to the node just before the desired position, adjust the next and prev pointers.

##### Deletion:

From the Beginning: Update the head to the next node, adjust the prev pointer of the new head and the next pointer of the tail.
From the End: Update the tail to the previous node, adjust the next pointer of the new tail and the prev pointer of the head.
From the Middle: Adjust the next and prev pointers of the surrounding nodes to bypass the node to be deleted.

##### Traversal:

Forward Traversal: Start from the head and follow the next pointers until you reach the head again.
Backward Traversal: Start from the tail and follow the prev pointers until you reach the tail again.

# Day 6: Header Linked Lists and Problem-Solving

## Theory

### Header Linked Lists:

Concept: A header linked list contains a special header node at the beginning which may not contain any meaningful data. It is used to simplify insertion and deletion operations.
Structure: Similar to singly or doubly linked lists but with an extra header node.
Benefits: Simplifies edge cases like insertion or deletion at the beginning of the list.

#### Complex Problem-Solving:

##### Merging Sorted Lists:

Approach: Traverse both lists simultaneously, compare elements, and build a new sorted list.
Removing Duplicates:

Approach: Use a hash set to track seen elements and remove duplicates during traversal.

##### Adding Numbers Represented by Linked Lists:

Approach: Traverse both lists, add corresponding digits along with carry, and handle different lengths of lists.
