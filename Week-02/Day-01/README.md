# Day 1: Introduction to Singly Linked Lists

## Theory

### Singly Linked Lists:
A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element, called a node, contains two parts:

Data: The value stored in the node.
Next: A pointer/reference to the next node in the sequence.
The list starts with a head pointer that points to the first node. If the list is empty, the head pointer is null.

### Basic Operations:

Insertion: Adding a new node to the list.
At the beginning.
At the end.
At a specific position (middle).
Deletion: Removing a node from the list.
Traversal: Accessing each node in the list in sequence.
