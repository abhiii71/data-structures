# Day 1: Introduction to Binary Trees

## What is a Binary Tree?

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. It is used to represent hierarchical data and supports efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

### Terminology:

Node: The basic unit of a tree, which contains data and links to other nodes.
Root: The topmost node in a tree.
Leaves (Leaf Nodes): Nodes with no children.
Internal Nodes: Nodes with at least one child.
Subtrees: Trees formed by a node and its descendants.

### Types of Binary Trees:

Full Binary Tree: Every node has 0 or 2 children.
Complete Binary Tree: All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.
Perfect Binary Tree: All internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.
Balanced Binary Tree: The height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most one.

### Tree Properties:

Height: The number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf.
Depth: The number of edges from the root to the node.
Level: The level of a node is the number of edges on the path from the root to the node.
