# Day 2: Advanced Stack Applications

## Concepts

1. Stack-based Expression Evaluation: Infix, Prefix, and Postfix Expressions

### Infix Expressions:

Standard arithmetic expressions (e.g., 3 + 4).
Operators are between operands.
Require operator precedence and associativity rules for evaluation.

#### Prefix Expressions (Polish Notation):

Operators precede their operands (e.g., + 3 4).
Evaluated right-to-left.
No need for parentheses to dictate evaluation order.

#### Postfix Expressions (Reverse Polish Notation):

Operators follow their operands (e.g., 3 4 +).
Evaluated left-to-right.
No need for parentheses; inherently respects operator precedence.

2. Use of Stacks in Depth-First Search (DFS) for Graphs

#### DFS:

Traversal algorithm used for trees and graphs.
Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
Can be implemented using recursion (implicit stack) or an explicit stack.
