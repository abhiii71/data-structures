# Day 7: Comprehensive Review and Practice - Deep Dive

## Stacks:
### Concepts:

Definition: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.

### Operations:

Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Remove the top element from the stack.
Peek/Top: Get the top element without removing it.
isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.

### Complexity:

Time Complexity: Push, pop, and peek operations are O(1).
Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the stack.

### Applications:

Expression Evaluation: Converting and evaluating postfix and prefix expressions.
Function Call Management: Handling recursive function calls in programming languages.
Undo Mechanisms: Implementing undo operations in text editors.
Balanced Parentheses: Checking for balanced parentheses in expressions.
Backtracking: Used in algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS).

## Queues:
### Concepts:

Definition: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.

### Operations:

Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue.
Dequeue: Remove the front element from the queue.
Front/Peek: Get the front element without removing it.
isEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.

### Complexity:

Time Complexity: Enqueue and dequeue operations are O(1).
Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue.

### Types of Queues:

Circular Queue: The last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle.
Priority Queue: Elements are added based on their priority, not just their arrival time.
Deque (Double-Ended Queue): Allows insertion and deletion at both ends.

### Applications:

Level Order Traversal: Used in Breadth-First Search (BFS) in trees and graphs.
Scheduling: Used in operating systems for job scheduling.
Buffering: Used in data streaming and IO buffering.
Sliding Window: Problems like sliding window maximum.
