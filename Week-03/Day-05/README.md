# Day 5: Applications of Stacks and Queues

## 1. Stacks in Backtracking Algorithms (e.g., DFS):

Depth-First Search (DFS): An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root (or an arbitrary node) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
Applications: Solving puzzles (e.g., mazes, Sudoku), pathfinding in graphs, and cycle detection in graphs.

## 2. Queues in Level Order Traversal of Trees (BFS):

Breadth-First Search (BFS): An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root (or an arbitrary node) and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
Applications: Finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, web crawlers, and peer-to-peer networks.
