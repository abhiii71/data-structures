# Day 6: Advanced Problems and Optimization - Deep Dive
## Morning

### Concepts:

1. Optimizing Stack and Queue Operations:

Time Complexity Optimization: Improving the efficiency of stack and queue operations to achieve O(1) or amortized O(1) time complexity for critical operations.
Memory Management: Techniques to handle large datasets efficiently in memory, minimizing overhead and ensuring data integrity.

2. Handling Large Data and Memory Management:

Efficient Data Structures: Using dynamic arrays, linked lists, and deques to optimize space usage.
Garbage Collection: Understanding how memory management works in different programming environments to avoid memory leaks and fragmentation.
