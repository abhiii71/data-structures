# Day 4: Introduction to Queues

## Concepts

1. Definition and Characteristics of a Queue:

Queue: A data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.

### Characteristics:

Elements are added to the rear (end) and removed from the front.
The first element added is the first one to be removed.

2. Use Cases:

Task Scheduling: Queues are used in operating systems to manage tasks and processes.
Breadth-First Search (BFS): BFS algorithm for graph traversal uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored.

#### Operations

Enqueue: Add an element to the end.
Dequeue: Remove the front element.
Front: View the front element without removing it.
IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.
