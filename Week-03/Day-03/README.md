# Day 3: Stack Problems and Optimization

## Concepts

1. Optimization Techniques for Stack-based Algorithms:

Efficient Use of Space: Minimize the memory footprint by reusing stack space when possible and avoiding unnecessary data storage.
Amortized Analysis: Evaluate the time complexity of a sequence of operations, ensuring that the average time per operation is optimal even if individual operations may take longer.
Lazy Evaluation: Defer computations until absolutely necessary, reducing unnecessary processing.

2. Common Pitfalls and Best Practices in Stack Implementations:

## Pitfalls:

Stack Overflow: Be cautious of unbounded recursion or pushing too many elements without proper bounds.
Underflow: Ensure you check if the stack is empty before popping or peeking to avoid errors.
Memory Leaks: Properly manage memory in languages without automatic garbage collection.

## Best Practices:

Encapsulation: Keep stack operations encapsulated within a well-defined interface.
Consistency: Maintain consistency in stack operations to avoid unexpected behaviors.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage underflow and overflow conditions.
