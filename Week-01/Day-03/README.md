# Day 3: Multi-Dimensional Arrays

## Theory:
In programming, multi-dimensional arrays provide a way to store and manipulate data in multiple dimensions. The most common types of multi-dimensional arrays are 2D arrays and 3D arrays.

### 2D Arrays:
A 2D array, also known as a matrix, consists of rows and columns. Each element in a 2D array is identified by its row and column index. 2D arrays are often used to represent grids, tables, or matrices in various applications.

### 3D Arrays:
A 3D array extends the concept of a 2D array by adding another dimension. It can be thought of as a collection of 2D arrays. Each element in a 3D array is identified by its depth, row, and column index. 3D arrays are less common but can be useful for representing volumetric data or multi-dimensional structures.

### Memory Layout and Indexing:

Row-major Order: Elements are stored row by row. Accessing elements involves iterating through rows first.

Column-major Order: Elements are stored column by column. Accessing elements involves iterating through columns first.

Efficiency Considerations: Understand the impact of memory access patterns on performance, especially in large matrices.
