# Day 1: Introduction to Arrays

## Theory

### Concept of Arrays

An array is a collection of elements, all of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
Arrays provide a way to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

### Array Indexing

Each element in an array is identified by an index.
In Go, array indexing starts from 0. Therefore, the first element is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on.
You can access any element in the array by its index.

### Memory Allocation

Arrays in Go have a fixed size, determined at the time of declaration.
The size of the array cannot be changed after it is declared.
The array elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, making it efficient to access elements by index.

### Summary
Arrays are a fundamental data structure used to store collections of elements.
Understanding how to initialize, access, insert, and delete elements in arrays is crucial for efficient data manipulation in Go.
Feel free to try out the [example code](https://github.com/helloabhii/go-dsa/blob/master/Week-01/Day-01/ques/main.go) and modify it to get a better understanding of how arrays work in Go.
