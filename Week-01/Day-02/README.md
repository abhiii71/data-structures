# Day 2: Array Traversal and Manipulation

## Theory

### Array Traversal

Array traversal involves visiting each element of an array in a systematic manner. Typically, this is done using loops.

### Traversal Techniques:

For Loop: A simple and commonly used loop for array traversal.

### Manipulating Array Elements
Manipulating array elements includes modifying, finding, and replacing elements.


## Summary
In Day 2, I have covered the fundamental concepts of array traversal and manipulation. 
Understanding these basics is crucial for efficient data handling and operations in programming. 
I learned how to traverse arrays using loops, modify specific elements, search for elements, and replace elements within an array. 
These operations form the foundation of more complex data manipulation and processing tasks in programming.For more [click here](https://github.com/helloabhii/go-dsa/blob/master/Week-01/Day-02/Ques/main.go)
